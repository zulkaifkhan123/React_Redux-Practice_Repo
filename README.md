# React Redux & Redux Toolkit Practice

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is created to practice **React Redux** and **Redux Toolkit** concepts.  
The main purpose of this repository is to learn how **state management** works in large React applications.

Instead of passing data from one component to another, Redux helps us manage data in a **central place** called the store.

---

## 🧠 What is Redux?

**Redux** is a state management library used with React.  
It helps store and manage application data in one central location.

### Example:
If many components need user data (like name or login status), Redux stores it in one place and all components can access it.

## 🧰 What is Redux Toolkit?

**Redux Toolkit** is the official and recommended way to use Redux.  
It reduces code, avoids mistakes, and makes Redux easier to understand.

### Benefits:
- Less boilerplate code
- Simple configuration
- Built-in best practices

## 🔗 What is React Redux?

**React Redux** is a library that connects Redux with React.  
It provides hooks like:
- `useSelector()` → to read data from the store
- `useDispatch()` → to send actions to the store
